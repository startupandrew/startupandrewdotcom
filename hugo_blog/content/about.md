I was born and raised in Minnesota, where I learned to program and do gymnastics as a child. I then moved to Indiana where I double-majored in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2006. Subsequently, I moved to sunny California.

Together with [James](https://twitter.com/jamestamplin), I've started several startups. By far the most successful one was [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which we started in 2011. We sold the company to Google in 2014, where we continued to work and grow the business. Firebase is now by far the largest platform for mobile and web app development in the world. It's [used by ~15% of all developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) (rivaling iOS in terms of developer usage, as a comparison).

I left Google in December 2017, and since then I've been an active angel investor. So far I've invested in about 40 companies, spanning developer tools, electric vehicles, renewable energy, retail, news, and more. You can see some of the startups in my portfolio [on AngelList](https://angel.co/andrew-lee). I'm also an active philanthropist, largely focused on building infrastructure in frontier markets. I have a special focus on Haiti, given my experiences in the earthquake there.

Some of you may know my brother [Tim](https://twitter.com/binarybits), who writes about technology things much more frequently than I.

I currently live in San Francisco, California, though I travel frequently. In addition to angel investing and charity work, I'm working on some projects to protect digital freedoms through better technology and infrastructure. You can follow me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/startupandrew).
